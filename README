========================

Human is a small program which translate numbers into a human readable format.
By default, it tries to detect the best factorisation, but you can force its
output.

You can adjust the number of decimals by tweaking the environment variable
$SCALE.

    # convert 123456 to the best human factorisation
    human 123456
    121K

    # output 2 decimals
    SCALE=2 human 123456
    120.56K

    SCALE=3 human -m 123456
    0.118M

Well, that's it (and that's enough !)
